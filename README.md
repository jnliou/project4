# Machine Learning Modelling on Malaria Cell Image Recognition
![![science](Dataset/scienceimage.jpg)](Dataset/scienceimage.jpg)

The primary aim of the project is to analyze cell image data of subjects that have malaria and subjects that do not have malaria and apply machine learning principles which will allow the machine to predict whether or not a subject has malaria. This can assist healthcare practitioners on easier metrics in terms of diagnosis, as well as the general public. This can allow the general public to possibly seek out further medical assistance if they believe they may have malaria.

**Data Transformation**
After cleaning, we transformed the data to make it suitable for our analysis and Machine Learning purposes. This involved the following:


**Data Integration**
Once we had consistent structures of data, we integrated it into a single DataFrame using SQLite.

**Step 6: Data Export**


## FLASK 

We utilized SQLAlchemy and Flask to create API routes in JSON format for 

* Codes found here for helping to run Flask: [helper.py](helper.py)
* To run Flask: [app.py](app.py)
* SQLite Database: [WRITEHERE.db](project3.db)
* Queries on SQLite to create tables: [SQLite-query](sqlite-query)
